This repository contains the code for a network of AI Agents that work together to analyze a user's youtube channel, its competitors, and the latest trends on youtube in order to make recommendations on future content ideas.

Credit to Arseny Shatokhin for the [Agency Swarm Framework](https://github.com/VRSEN/agency-swarm/blob/main/.cursorrules) that provided the base roles and rules for cooperation between agents.

This project was coded entirely through prompts in cursor.
